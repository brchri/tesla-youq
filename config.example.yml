# This is an example config file with all available options and explanations for anything that isn't necessarily obvious.
# For a simpler example, please refer to the config.simple.example.yml file. Please also refer to the README for more information.

# In this config example, there are three garage doors we wish to control that are connected to the same account.
# The first garage door houses 2 Tesla vehicles, while the second and third garage doors house a single Tesla vehicle each.
# Anytime a garage door is operated by this app, it will wait the configured 5 minutes "cooldown" before allowing
# further operations on that specific garage door.
