# In this config example, there are two garage doors we wish to control that are connected to the same account.
# The first garage door houses 2 Tesla vehicles, while the second garage door houses a third Tesla vehicle.
# Anytime a garage door is operated by this app, it will wait the configured 5 minutes "cooldown" before allowing
# further operations on that specific garage door.
